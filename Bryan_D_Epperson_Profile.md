## About me
Hello, welcome to my profile as this is where you get to know a little about me. I'm from Letcher County, KY. I like to play my guitar and video games and I also like to read a lot.
I became a computer scientist in hopes of pursuing some career in game development. Right now I'm working on a game development project on unity for my Capstone class so this should 
be fun! I hope this satifies the profile portion!
